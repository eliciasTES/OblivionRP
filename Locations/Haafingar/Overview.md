# 🌲 Falkreath Hold Overview

Falkreath Hold lies in the southern reaches of Skyrim, a region dominated by dense pine forests, misty mountains, and quiet valleys. It borders Cyrodiil to the south and is known for its haunting beauty, deep history, and ties to death and memory.

## 🛡️ Capital
- **Falkreath City**: The seat of power, governed by Jarl Siddgeir. Known for its large graveyard and somber atmosphere. The guards are loyal but weary.

## 🕯️ Major Locations
- **Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary**  
  Hidden beneath the earth near the road west of Falkreath. The ancient assassin's guild hides here, practicing their dark rites.

- **Helgen**  
  Once a fortified town, now ruined. The dragon Alduin attacked here at the start of the civil war — could be reclaimed or rebuilt in your campaign.

- **Orphan Rock**  
  A hagraven-dominated grove surrounded by witches and magical energies. You've expanded this into a central coven settlement for roleplay purposes.

## 🧭 Minor Locations
- **Moss Mother Cavern** – A serene cavern with hidden dangers and lost hunters.
- **Pinewatch** – A suspicious cabin hiding a major bandit hideout beneath.
- **Fort Neugrad** – An Imperial stronghold, sometimes overrun by Stormcloaks or bandits.
- **Bonechill Passage** – A frozen tunnel connecting parts of the hold.
- **South Shriekwind Bastion** – A vampire-infested crypt filled with ancient puzzles.

## ⚔️ Points of Interest
